A version 5 GUID (aka UUID) is one generated from the SHA1 hash of a namespace and a value. This is useful for generating a predictable GUID based on another type of value, such as a string or number.

This is a sample project for creating a version 5 GUID in C#.

See the code in [Program.cs](Program.cs).
